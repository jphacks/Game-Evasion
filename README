You are a smiley face, and you have to evade the sad faces.
This game was made back in 2011 when I started learning how to program so it's very simple.

You need to have PyGame installed before playing this game: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Run evasion_main to play the game.
Use the mouse to move the smiley and
click to fire bullets
